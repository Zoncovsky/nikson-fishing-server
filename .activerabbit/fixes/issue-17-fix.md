## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The error message "Test error from ActiveRabbit!" suggests that this is a custom error or a test error intentionally raised within the application, possibly for testing purposes. However, without specific source code or a detailed backtrace, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact location or cause within the application.

## 🔧 Suggested Fix

To address this issue, locate the part of the code where this custom error is raised. It might look something like this:

```ruby
raise StandardError, "Test error from ActiveRabbit!"
```

Once located, you can either remove this line if it's no longer needed or handle it appropriately by wrapping it in a conditional statement to ensure it only executes under certain conditions (e.g., in a test environment).
